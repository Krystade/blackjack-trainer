# Living Backlog

The single place improvement ideas land, get grounded, and get ranked. Point-in-time
syntheses (like `research/2026-07-21-priority-list.md`) feed this; this file is the
current truth. Process: operator ideas + the adversarial/research loop add candidates
here; nothing ships until it's ranked against what's already listed.

**Voice decision (settled 2026-07-23):** default voice = **Bella** (`af_bella`, already
the shipped `index.json` default); **George** kept as a switchable option. Emma remains
shipped as a third choice unless the operator asks to drop it.

## Candidates — operator-sourced

### D1 · Distraction training (operator idea 2026-07-23) — HIGH interest
Mid-drill interruptions that simulate the real-table cost of talking while counting:
pause the card stream, inject a challenge that MUST be answered, then resume; the final
count is graded as usual — the skill being trained is *holding the count through
interference*.

- **Interference types**, escalating:
  - **Near-count math** (operator's key insight): arithmetic whose operands/answers sit
    near the current running count — if the count is +7, ask "8 + 6?" — maximally
    confusable, which is the point. The wrong count you end up with IS the failure mode
    real table-talk produces.
  - **Generic quiz questions**: table-talk simulacra ("what's 12 × 4?", simple trivia)
    that occupy the verbal loop without number-adjacency.
- Works visual AND eyes-free (spoken interruption, keyboard/zone/spoken answer).
- **Research grounding already in hand**: the practitioner pain-point report ranks
  "conversing while counting / dealer speed changes / distraction" as the top
  real-table breakdown practice doesn't prepare people for, and CVBJ ships dealer
  distractions as a named feature. This is the highest-confidence candidate in the file.
- Design notes: frequency/difficulty settings (off / occasional / relentless); the
  interruption's own answer is graded too (both wrong-count and wrong-answer are
  failures); telemetry should record counts-kept-through-distraction separately.

### D2 · Ideas raised earlier and still open
- Countdown/tag-guess submode has no eyes-free support (excluded twice, deliberately —
  needs an explicit keep/kill decision).
- Corrections are not clipped (symbol-heavy index labels fall back to live TTS) — a
  wording cleanup of `reason` strings would make them clippable AND better-spoken.
- Token-level clip concatenation for multi-card groups at `full` card detail (currently
  falls back to live TTS; rank/face detail already fully clipped).

## Candidates — from the adversarial/research loop
*(populated by the standing workflow below)*

## Parked (unchanged)
M6 bot-mistake RNG correlated with shoe seed · M8 bot cards render instantly while
narration paces · `dealSpeedMs` stale in-flight timer · `cvcxParse` single-space
decorated negative TC · payout audit's 2 trivial insurance quadrants · `game.ts` ~949
lines · `Stats.tsx` reads `loadSettings().audio` directly.

## The standing adversarial + research workflow

Run when the operator asks for "what's next", or after any major ship. Three legs, then
a synthesis pass into this file's Candidates section:

1. **ADVERSARIAL red-team**: a fresh agent attacks the CURRENT app as a training
   system from two personas — a professional counter ("what will still fail at a real
   table despite acing every drill here?") and a learning scientist ("what does this
   training regime mistrain or leave unmeasured?"). Output: ranked attack list with a
   concrete feature/fix per attack.
2. **TRAINING-SCIENCE research**: evidence hunt on skill-acquisition literature —
   dual-task/distraction training, interleaving vs blocking, spaced repetition,
   speed-accuracy tradeoffs, difficulty progression — mapped to concrete app changes,
   cited, `[VERIFIED]`/`[INFERENCE]` tagged.
3. **COMMUNITY deep-hunt**: training methods practitioners actually describe, drills
   coaches assign, complaints about existing trainers — using sources that worked last
   time (Blackjack Info archives, qfit manuals, CasinoCityTimes) plus new angles for
   the blocked ones (Reddit remains hard-blocked; treat absence as unknown, not
   negative).

Rules carried from the first research pass: cite a URL per claim, quarantine
search-snippet-only sources, say plainly when evidence is thin, and never let a lead
into Candidates without a one-line "why it makes the counting practice better".
